          Trading in <span className="text-[#9D5CFF]">SkinsMonkey.com</span>{" "}
          does not involve any fiduciary currency or cryptocurrency. Trading in{" "}
          <span className="text-[#9D5CFF]">SkinsMonkey.com</span> is available
          only through exchange one Virtual Item for another Virtual Item, or
          optionally, by using drawing rights issued by us specifically for the

          Rights might not be used elsewhere or exchanged for any fiduciary
          currency or cryptocurrency.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-300/60">
          For your convenience only, our Drawing Rights are issued in the
          prearranged units which are shown on our platform as equivalent to the
          units of the fiduciary currency, typically US Dollars (USD). Unless
          provided otherwise, 1 prearranged unit of our Drawing Rights is
          represented on our platform as 1 unit of the fiduciary currency
          involved, typically 1 US Dollar (USD). For avoidance of doubt, 1
          prearranged unit of our Drawing Rights might not be exchanged for 1 US
          Dollar or its equivalent in any other fiduciary currency or
          cryptocurrency. The amount of prearranged units of our Drawing Rights
          acquired by you will constitute balance of your account open on our
          platform presented as corresponding units of fiduciary currency (the{" "}
          <span className="text-[#9D5CFF]">"Balance"</span>).
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-300/60">
          In principle, you acquire our Drawing Rights when exchanging your
          Virtual Item valued on our platform higher than the Virtual Item you
          receive as a result of such exchange. In such situation, the
          difference between (i) the value of your Virtual Item, which you trade
          through our platform and (ii) the value of the Virtual Item you
          receive in exchange will constitute the amount of prearranged units of
          our Drawing Rights which you will receive and what will be reflected
          in your positive Balance.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-300/60">
          Alternatively, we may issue our Drawing Rights upon subscription. You
          can make subscription order to our Drawing Rights only by using our
          platform. The availability of our Drawing Rights might be limited,
          hence your subscription might not be accepted by us. Notwithstanding
          the foregoing, we specifically reserve our right to grant the Drawing
          Rights to any User upon our sole discretion without subscription.

        <p className="text-gray-300/60">
          In order to place subscription order for our Drawing Rights, you shall
          pay us the price calculated in fiduciary currency and provided on our

          Rights is solely upon our discretion and vary from time to time.

        <p className="text-gray-300/60">
          If your subscription order is accepted and the subscription price is
          credited on our fiduciary currency account in its entirety, without
          any set-offs, deductions, or other modifications, you acquire the
          right to use Drawing Rights on our platform.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-300/60">
          If you have positive Balance, you may place an order to redeem Drawing
          Rights by using our platform. Our decision whether we agree or not
          agree to accept your redemption order is solely within our discretion.
          If your redemption order is accepted by us, the amount of your Drawing
          Rights being subject of redemption will be cancelled, which will be
          reflected in your debited Balance. If your redemption order is
          accepted, we will pay you the amount in fiduciary currency which will
          be the product of (i) the amount of prearranged units of our Drawing
          Rights multiplied by (ii) the redemption price expressed in fiduciary
          currency for one prearranged unit of our Drawing Rights established
          upon our sole discretion and provided to you upon acceptance of your
          redemption order.

        <p className="text-gray-300/60">
          At any time your Balance shall not exceed the amount of prearranged
          units of our Drawing Rights shown as USD 15,000. To access Balance you
          may be asked to provide registration details, including without
          limitation a payment method, a related billing address and all
          necessary KYC information about the Account owner. Balance does not
          constitute a personal property and has no value. Balance is

          Risk

          Before using our Services, it is crucial that you understand the risks
          associated with Virtual Items, Drawing Rights and our Services.
          Trading Virtual Items and using Drawing Rights involves multiple
          risks. You hereby declare that you are aware and familiar with all
          risks related to Virtual Items and Drawing Rights, in particular risks
          listed below. You are aware that such a list is not exhaustive and is
          not intended to be exhaustive. In our belief it refers to most common
          risks associated with Virtual items and Drawing Rights and some of
          them may apply in high extent and some to lesser extent. You must
          independently or with help of your advisor determine your risk
          appetite and determine if you want to exchange your Virtual Items with
          us or subscribe to our Drawing Rights. You bear sole responsibility
          for materialisation of any such or similar risk and cannot make any
          claims against us. If you don't have knowledge about risk associated
          with Virtual Items, you should acquaint yourself with them first and
          reconsider if you are willing to trade with us.

          Virtual Items might be used only within Steam platform, therefore they

          Prices of Virtual Items fluctuate rapidly and in short period may
          loose significant value, in particular Virtual Items are not backed up
          by any fiduciary currency, cryptocurrency, precious metals,
          commodities or any other tangible or intangible asset, therefore they
          actual market value might be or become null.
