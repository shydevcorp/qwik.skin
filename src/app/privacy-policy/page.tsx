          A personal data breach may, if not addressed in an appropriate and

          your rights and freedoms. Therefore, as soon as we become aware that a
          personal data breach has occurred, we will notify the personal data
          breach to the Commissioner for Personal Data Protection without undue
          delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become
          aware of it, unless we are able to demonstrate, in accordance with the
          accountability principle, that the personal data breach is unlikely to
          result in a risk to your rights and freedoms. Where such notification
          cannot be achieved within 72 hours, the reasons for the delay should
          accompany the notification without undue further delay.
